# SmartUse - Land, Growth and Big Data

The growth of the economy and demographics has until now required the continued expansion of infrastructure and settlement space. The sustainable transformation of urban landscapes can only succeed today, however, when spatial development transitions from a "hardware-oriented" planning of offers, to a "software-oriented" approach in land use management.

## Starting point

For a long time, questions about the development of human settlement were answered to a large degree by the tender planning process. Part of a [cooperation program](http://www.metropolitanraum-zuerich.ch/themen/kooperationsprogramm.html), the *[Smart Use](http://smartuse.ch)* project aims to focus settlement development more strongly on the actual behaviour of land users, and therefore with new data sources to better understand their actual demand.

The daily routines between home, working and leisure time are to be examined in the entire Metropolitan area of Zurich, with a focus on the quality and the intensity of use of public spaces, streets and open areas.

## Implementation as cooperation project

Today, data from public transport companies, telecommunications companies and digital service create new possibilities to understand our behavior in space and time - quickly and independently of administrative boundaries. Project "Smart Use" mobilizes these resources to identify patterns of use, extrapolate functional interrelationships, and to focus on areas where behaviour, settlement structures and strategic plans intersect, suggesting detailed examination ("deep dives"). Last but not least, "Smart Use", should serve to bring awareness of new data sources to spatial development and to start a dialogue.

Thanks to the findings of this project, the cities, cantons and municipalities in the Metropolitan area of Zurich will receive access to a new tool and new insights in spatial development - and, through the deep dives, specific waypoints to take into account in their own planning and implementations.

## Aim of the Metropolitan Conference of Zurich

The Research & Development approach of the project has practical relevance thanks to a focus on the effective management of space. *Smart Use* promises to make a significant contribution to sustainable design of the economic and living space, and to formulate concrete recommendations for future handling of the consequences of population and economic growth in the settlement development area.
